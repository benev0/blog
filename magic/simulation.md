As everyone knows blue is clearly the best color in Richard Garfield's magic the gathering. Not only does blue have the best cards including the classy stack interaction that is counterspell, but blue's original card border is a marbled masterpiece.

## The Inspiration

One of the most dangerous things a magic player can do is watch other people play magic. To set the seen I was watching a commander game when I saw a funny combo. Once you have accumulated 5 copies of *Templar Knight* simply attack and pay W and just drop a *Thrumming Stone* it onto the battlefield. Now the next templar knight you play if you have a significant fraction of your deck will allow you very good odds to pull every other *Templar Knight* from your deck directly onto the battlefield. Now not only do you have a board full of a *Templar Knight* but you now have the option to tutor the apocalypse from your deck directly out onto the board (*Blightsteel Colossus* for example.)

## The Deck
The basic combo of play *Thrumming Stone* paired with these a *Relentless Rats* style card: one of the first cards printed with `A deck can have any number of cards named ...`. This combo in itself is already excellent, but the question is now that this collection of creatures is on the battle field what is the win condition. With *Templar Knight* it is a collection of legendary artifacts, but for another card it is entirely different.

Bringing back the best color in magic, blue, there is one *Relentless Rats* style card *Persistent Petitioners*. This card although new does have a vintage border variant not to mention opening up one of the most infuriating win conditions.
